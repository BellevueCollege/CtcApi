		///		This interface provides a customization point for schools to provide their own business logic

		///		this customization because the HP (and thus the ODS) contains two course description tables
		///		(<i>CourseDescription</i> and <i>CourseDescription2</i> in the ODS), and different schools
		///		utilize these in different ways.
		///		</para>
